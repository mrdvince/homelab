            Review this major dependency update PR: ${{ github.repository }}/pull/${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}

            Steps:
            1. Use gh to get the PR diff and identify what's being updated (package name, old version, new version)
            2. Determine the package type (container image, helm chart, github action)
            3. Find and fetch the changelog or release notes:
               - For container images: check the project's GitHub releases or CHANGELOG
               - For helm charts: check the chart's GitHub releases or artifacthub.io
               - For github actions: check the action's GitHub releases
            4. Identify breaking changes between the old and new versions
            5. Assess impact on this homelab setup by checking how the dependency is used in the codebase

            Post a PR comment with (Don't use overly verbose markdown or emojis):
            - Summary of what's being updated
            - Key changes and new features
            - Breaking changes (if any)
            - Migration steps needed (if any)
            - Recommendation: safe to merge, needs manual testing, or needs code changes

            Use WebFetch to get changelogs/release notes. Use gh CLI for GitHub API calls.
            Be concise but thorough. Focus on actionable information.
